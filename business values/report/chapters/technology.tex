- main model:
state-of-the-art model for pose estimation from papers with code
or alternatively:
YOLO runs live within the app on the device of the user, outputs the keypoints and we only classify on those, meaning only the keypoints are sent to the cloud, which is probably a decent abstraction...

- fine tuning:
with own dataset according to RULA

- data privacy:
We need to ensure that the privacy of our customers is kept safe. Therefore we propose a preprocessing of the videofeed within the app to so that only privacy-preserved data leaves the users device and ends up in the cloud where it is inserted into the machine learning model.

- which XAI Method to detect which bodypart is wrongly positioned?
- Advice with arrows in the image on how to correct the posture?

- dashboard with which packages?

- eventually get TÜV certification?
