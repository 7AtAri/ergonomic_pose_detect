We need to ensure that the privacy of our customers is kept safe. Therefore we propose a preprocessing of the videofeed within the app to so that only privacy-preserved data leaves the users device and ends up in the cloud where it is inserted into the machine learning model.

or alternatively:
YOLO runs live within the app on the device of the user, outputs the keypoints and we only classify on those, meaning only the keypoints are sent to the cloud, which is probably a decent abstraction...
