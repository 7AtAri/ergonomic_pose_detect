The project that was detailed in this report is a promising development. It offers much better scalabilty than a typical computer vision startup due to solution being mostly client-side. It taps into underdeveloped market with few competitors. It provides a solution to a problem that will only grow bigger as society ages and becomes more sedentiary.

Initial investment and projected maximum loss are low as startups go - only 65000€ and 70000€. This is not a blitzscaler that wil continue burning through the money for decades to come. In the world, where interest rates are no longer indestinguishible from zero, more steady and methodic approach is much more sensible.

It would also be important to note, that the estimations provided in the report are conservative in a number of ways. For example, it does not take into account various incubator programs, such as one provided by the BHT, while it could save a lot of expenses, such as providing infrastructure or legal guidance, as well as partially compensating lost salaries.

Overall, this project has a potential. A potential to be Germany's new hidden gem company - not a flashy name that would provoke a hundred imitators, but simply a team of professionals that are the best at what they do. And Germany would be wise to support it.
