Many people use their computers daily, whether to work, study or play games.
And with the heavy reliance on laptops and their portability, people often forget about
their posture which lead to back pain and many sessions at the physiotherapist!

Even though some companies try to mitigate this problem by providing ergonomic furniture
and standing desks but that does not apply to all companies due to the high cost. 
Additionally, after Covid=19 many companies started operating remotely or in a hybrid manner 
which led to employees depending on their own furniture which most likely is not ergonomic.
