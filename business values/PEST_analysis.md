We want to introduce a new software product / app into the market.
When introducing a new product it is always a good idea to do a 
PEST-analysis, since this is an analysis which can inform decision making processes,
like strategic planning and give insights into the external factors of a SWOT-analyis.

   - Gather relevant data and information.
     This may include market research, industry reports, and current news relevant to the business or project.
  


1. **Political Factors**:
   - Analyze how government policies and political stability might impact the business.
   - Consider factors like tax policies, trade restrictions and tariffs, environmental laws, labor laws, political stability, and changes in political leadership.
   - Assess the potential risks or opportunities arising from these political factors.
  
The most important political factors that might influence our business model might be
labor laws, data privacy protection laws, AI related laws and copyright laws.

When it comes to labor laws, our business model might mostly profit. 
The Workplace Ordinance (ArbSt√§ttV) regulates the basic requirements for workplaces and specifies the responsibilities employers have towards employees with regard to the design and maintenance of their workplace. The ordinance serves to ensure the safety and protect the health of employees when setting up and operating workplaces:
"When setting up and operating workplaces, the employer shall implement the measures in accordance with Section 3 (1), taking into account the state of the art, occupational medicine and hygiene, ergonomic requirements and, in particular, the rules and findings published by the Federal Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs in accordance with Section 7 (4)."

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulates the handling of personal data and is also applicable to employee data. Employers must ensure that personal data is processed in accordance with the principles of the GDPR.
This means that our data product needs to fulfill the GDPR, otherwise we can not sell it B2B. 
Also our buisness model might be influenced by the implementation of the EU AI Act. "Conducting a risk assessment to determine the level of risk associated with your AI system" may be recommended. https://www.credo.ai/eu-ai-act?utm_term=ai%20eu%20act&utm_campaign=EU+AI+Act&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=9234903900&hsa_cam=20678021731&hsa_grp=1328212367439342&hsa_ad=&hsa_src=o&hsa_tgt=kwd-83014213781517:loc-72&hsa_kw=ai%20eu%20act&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3
