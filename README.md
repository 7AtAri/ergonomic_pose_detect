# ergonomic posture detection - 
      
- for learning from images

- [important links](learning_from_images/todo.md)


## todo checklist

- [x] set up own dataset

- [x] implement fine-tuning pipeline for yolo

- [x] keypoint angle calculation + rula rule assessment of ergonomic status

- [ ] integrate additional images into the dataset class folders

- [x] split our dataset into training/testing dataset

- [ ] implement fine-tuning pipeline for other state-of-the-art models

- [x] evaluation set up with metrics (see idea presentation)

- [ ] train our models

- [ ] prepare keynote/ppt presentation 


## Out created dataset

You can find the dataset we created for posture estimation on [BHT cloud](https://cloud.bht-berlin.de/index.php/s/3HTdw2MXqFR5SJy).
The postures are labeled with respect to the [RULA worksheet](https://ergo-plus.com/wp-content/uploads/RULA.pdf)
